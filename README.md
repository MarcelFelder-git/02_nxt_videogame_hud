## Short Description
**NXT VideoGame HUD** is a modern web application for exploring and discovering video games.  
Built with **Next.js, React, and TypeScript**, it allows users to search, filter, and view detailed information about games pulled in real time from the RAWG API.  

Find your next favorite title, manage a personal watchlist, or play a fun **Guess the Game** minigame to test your knowledge.
